**Abstract: Developing a Compression Pipeline for deploying Neural Networks in Wearable Sleep Apnoea Detection.**

Sleep apnoea is a common but often undiagnosed sleep disorder, where a person’s breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. It is connected to serious health problems like cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue, and reduced quality of life. Currently, diagnosis often requires overnight studies in specialist sleep laboratories. These are expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible for many people. Wearable health devices have the potential to make continuous, at-home monitoring more practical and affordable, but major challenges remain. Deep learning models required to detect apnoea episodes are often too large and computationally demanding to run effectively on resource-limited devices such as microcontrollers or low-powered mobile processors.

Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, particularly in how deep learning models can be adapted for real-world applications has been central to my research. AI models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be trained to recognise patterns in breathing, heart rate, or oxygen saturation data that indicate apnoea events. However, these models typically require powerful hardware and cloud-based processing, which creates problems with latency, battery efficiency, and privacy. Neural network compression provides a solution to this problem. Compression techniques, such as pruning (removing redundant connections), quantisation (reducing precision of weights and activations), and knowledge distillation (training smaller models to replicate larger models) make it possible to deploy efficient yet accurate models directly onto wearable devices.

My project involves developing and compressing deep learning models to detect apnoea episodes from physiological signals, such as respiration or ECG data, and deploying them on wearable-class hardware. The aim is to design a pipeline where a baseline model is trained on medical datasets, then compressed using pruning, quantisation and distillation methods, before ported onto a microcontroller or smartphone. This allows real-time detection of apnoea episodes during sleep without the need for cloud connectivity, improving accessibility and data privacy. By running the models directly on-device, the system minimises energy consumption, reduces reliance on external infrastructure, and ensures that sensitive health data remains secure. 

I started my project by training simple baseline models on public datasets. Initial experiments with compression methods have been executed to explore how much the models can be reduced in size without significantly harming accuracy. Currently, I am working to make these models compatible with edge hardware using frameworks like TensorFlow Lite Micro, with the goal of creating a wearable prototype that can run real-time detection. This work has the potential to make sleep apnoea detection more accessible worldwide while advancing research into efficient deep learning on constrained devices.
